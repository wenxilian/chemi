Chemistry Fundamentals Review Notes
Classification of Matter
Overview
Matter is classified into pure substances and mixtures based on composition. Pure substances have fixed chemical compositions and properties, while mixtures are physical combinations of multiple substances with variable compositions.
Core Concepts
Pure Substance (纯净物)

Definition: A substance composed of only one type of molecule or atom (e.g., H₂O, O₂, NaCl).
Types:

Element (单质): Pure substance consisting of one element (e.g., Fe, O₂, C₆₀).
Compound (化合物): Pure substance formed by two or more elements chemically bonded (e.g., CO₂, H₂SO₄, NaOH).



Mixture (混合物)

Definition: Physical combination of two or more pure substances without chemical bonding (e.g., air, salt water, alloy).
Types:

Homogeneous mixture (均匀混合物): Uniform composition (e.g., solution, air).
Heterogeneous mixture (非均匀混合物): Non-uniform composition (e.g., suspension, emulsion).



Key Distinctions


Comparison
Pure Substance
Mixture




Composition
Fixed (e.g., H₂O has H:O=2:1)
Variable (e.g., salt water浓度可变)


Properties
Definite melting/boiling point
No fixed melting/boiling point


Separation Method
Chemical reaction
Physical methods (distillation, filtration)


Examples:

✅ Pure substance: Ice-water mixture (only H₂O molecules), diamond (C).
❌ Misclassification: "Clean air is pure substance" (air contains N₂/O₂/CO₂ → mixture).
❗ Special case: A substance with one element may be a mixture (e.g., O₂ + O₃ mixture, diamond + graphite mixture).

Dispersion Systems
Overview
Dispersion systems are mixtures of dispersed phase (分散质) and dispersion medium (分散剂). They are classified by particle size: solution (<1 nm), colloid (1–100 nm), and suspension (>100 nm).
Core Concepts
Solution (溶液)

Definition: Homogeneous mixture with dissolved particles (ions/molecules) that cannot be filtered and do not scatter light.
Examples: NaCl(aq), HCl(aq).

Colloid (胶体)

Definition: System with particles (1–100 nm) that scatter light (Tyndall effect) and cannot pass through semipermeable membranes.
Properties:

Tyndall effect (丁达尔效应): Light beam visible in colloids (e.g., sunlight through forest mist).
Electrophoresis (电泳): Colloid particles move under electric field (e.g., Fe(OH)₃ colloid).


Examples: Milk, fog, blood, starch solution.

Suspension (浊液)

Definition: Heterogeneous mixture with large particles that settle over time (e.g., mud water, paint).

Key Distinctions

Examples:

✅ Colloid identification: Laser through "egg white solution" shows Tyndall effect.
❌ Common mistake: "FeCl₃ + NaOH reaction forms colloid" (actually forms Fe(OH)₃ precipitate, a suspension).

Electrolytes and Non-electrolytes
Overview
Electrolytes are substances that conduct electricity when dissolved in water or molten by dissociating into ions. Non-electrolytes do not conduct electricity.
Core Concepts
Electrolyte (电解质)

Definition: Substances that dissociate into ions in solution/molten state (e.g., NaCl, H₂SO₄, NaOH).
Types:

Strong electrolyte (强电解质): Completely dissociate (e.g., HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻; Na₂CO₃ → 2Na⁺ + CO₃²⁻).
Weak electrolyte (弱电解质): Partially dissociate (e.g., CH₃COOH ⇌ CH₃COO⁻ + H⁺; NH₃·H₂O ⇌ NH₄⁺ + OH⁻).



Non-electrolyte (非电解质)

Definition: Substances that do not dissociate into ions (e.g., sugar, ethanol, CO₂).

Ionization Equation (电离方程式)

Strong electrolytes: Use "→" (e.g., H₂SO₄ → 2H⁺ + SO₄²⁻; KOH → K⁺ + OH⁻).
Weak electrolytes: Use "⇌" (e.g., CH₃COOH ⇌ CH₃COO⁻ + H⁺).

Key Distinctions


Myth
Fact




"Pure water is non-electrolyte"
Pure water is weak electrolyte (H₂O ⇌ H⁺ + OH⁻), but conductivity is low.


"All acids are strong electrolytes"
Weak acids (CH₃COOH, H₂CO₃) are weak electrolytes.


"Electrolytes must conduct electricity in solid state"
NaCl solid does not conduct; only molten/aqueous NaCl conducts.


Examples:

✅ Electrolyte: Molten NaNO₃ (conducts via Na⁺ and NO₃⁻).
❌ Non-electrolyte: SO₂ (dissolves in water to form H₂SO₃, which conducts, but SO₂ itself is non-electrolyte).

Ionic Reactions
Overview
Ionic reactions occur between ions in aqueous solutions, represented by ionic equations focusing on participating ions.
Core Concepts
Ionic Equation Rules

Dissociable substances: Strong electrolytes (soluble salts, strong acids, strong bases) → write as ions.

Strong acids: HCl, H₂SO₄, HNO₃.
Strong bases: NaOH, KOH, Ba(OH)₂.
Soluble salts: Refer to solubility rules (e.g., Na⁺, K⁺, NH₄⁺ salts are soluble).


Non-dissociable substances:

Insoluble solids (e.g., CaCO₃, BaSO₄), gases (e.g., CO₂), weak electrolytes (e.g., H₂O, CH₃COOH), and单质 (e.g., Fe, Cu).



Ion Coexistence (离子共存)

Conditions: No precipitation, gas, weak electrolyte, or redox reaction.
Common incompatible ion pairs:

H⁺ with OH⁻, CO₃²⁻, HCO₃⁻, CH₃COO⁻.
OH⁻ with H⁺, Fe³⁺, Cu²⁺, NH₄⁺.
SO₄²⁻ with Ba²⁺; Cl⁻ with Ag⁺; CO₃²⁻ with Ca²⁺, Ba²⁺, Fe³⁺.



Key Distinctions


Reaction
Correct Ionic Equation
Mistake




HCl + CaCO₃
CaCO₃ + 2H⁺ → Ca²⁺ + CO₂↑ + H₂O
2H⁺ + CO₃²⁻ → CO₂↑ + H₂O (CaCO₃ is insoluble)


H₂SO₄ + Ba(OH)₂
Ba²⁺ + 2OH⁻ + 2H⁺ + SO₄²⁻ → BaSO₄↓ + 2H₂O
H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O (ignores BaSO₄ precipitate)


CH₃COOH + NaOH
CH₃COOH + OH⁻ → CH₃COO⁻ + H₂O
H⁺ + OH⁻ → H₂O (CH₃COOH is weak acid)


Example: In strongly acidic solution (H⁺ excess), "HCO₃⁻ + H⁺ → CO₂↑ + H₂O" so HCO₃⁻ cannot coexist with H⁺.
Chemical Nomenclature
Overview
Systematic naming of inorganic compounds follows IUPAC rules, including acids, bases, salts, and oxides.
Core Naming Rules
Bases (碱)

Rule: Metal cation + "hydroxide".
Examples:

NaOH: sodium hydroxide
Fe(OH)₃: iron(III) hydroxide (Roman numerals indicate metal valence)
Cu(OH)₂: copper(II) hydroxide



Acids (酸)

Binary acids: "Hydro-" + non-metal stem + "-ic acid" (e.g., HCl: hydrochloric acid; HI: hydroiodic acid).
Oxyacids: Based on anion name (e.g., H₂SO₄: sulfuric acid; HNO₃: nitric acid).

Salts (盐)

Normal salt (正盐): No H⁺/OH⁻ (e.g., Na₂CO₃: sodium carbonate; KNO₃: potassium nitrate).
Acid salt (酸式盐): Contains H⁺ (e.g., NaHCO₃: sodium bicarbonate; NaHSO₄: sodium bisulfate).
Naming: Cation + anion (e.g., CaCO₃: calcium carbonate; FeSO₄: iron(II) sulfate).

Key Distinctions


Incorrect Name
Correct Name
Reason




"iron(II) hydroxide" for Fe(OH)₃
iron(III) hydroxide
Fe(OH)₃ has Fe³⁺ (III), not Fe²⁺ (II)


"sodium hypochlorate" for NaClO₄
sodium perchlorate
ClO₄⁻ is perchlorate; ClO⁻ is hypochlorite


"dihydrogen sulfide" for H₂S
hydrogen sulfide
Binary acid naming rule: omit "di-" for H₂S


Chemical Reaction Types
Overview
Reactions are classified by reactant/product types or electron transfer.
Core Types
Basic Reaction Types

Combination (化合反应): A + B → AB (e.g., CO₂ + CaO → CaCO₃).
Decomposition (分解反应): AB → A + B (e.g., 2H₂O₂ → 2H₂O + O₂↑).
Displacement (置换反应): A + BC → AC + B (e.g., Zn + CuSO₄ → ZnSO₄ + Cu).
Double displacement (复分解反应): AB + CD → AD + CB (e.g., NaCl + AgNO₃ → AgCl↓ + NaNO₃).

Redox Reaction (氧化还原反应)

Definition: Reactions with electron transfer (valence change).
Relation to basic types:

All displacement reactions are redox.
Double displacement reactions are non-redox.



Key Distinctions


Reaction
Type
Redox?




Na₂O + H₂O → 2NaOH
Combination
No (valence unchanged)


Zn + CuSO₄ → ZnSO₄ + Cu
Displacement
Yes (Zn→Zn²⁺, Cu²⁺→Cu)


2H₂O₂ → 2H₂O + O₂↑
Decomposition
Yes (O⁻¹→O⁻² and O⁰)


Extended Knowledge (Potential Test Topics)
Allotropes (同素异形体)

Definition: Different forms of the same element (e.g., C₆₀ and C₇₀; diamond and graphite).
Key point: They are mixtures when coexisting (e.g., O₂ + O₃ mixture is not pure substance).

Ion Concentration and Conductivity

Conductivity depends on both ion concentration and charge (e.g., 1M H₂SO₄ conducts better than 1M HCl due to 2H⁺ vs 1H⁺).

Amphoteric Substances (两性物质)

Substances reacting with both acid and base (e.g., Al(OH)₃: Al(OH)₃ + 3H⁺ → Al³⁺ + 3H₂O; Al(OH)₃ + OH⁻ → AlO₂⁻ + 2H₂O).

Precipitation Reactions

Solubility rules:

Soluble: Na⁺, K⁺, NH₄⁺, NO₃⁻ salts.
Insoluble: BaSO₄, AgCl, CaCO₃, Fe(OH)₃.



By mastering these concepts and distinctions, you can systematically solve problems involving matter classification, ionic reactions, and chemical naming.
